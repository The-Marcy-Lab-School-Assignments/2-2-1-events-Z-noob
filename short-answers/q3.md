# Question

Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer

Helpful when we have a parent `div` that contains multiple child like buttons. This is when we use put the child in one shared event Handler to use later on. Then, we handle the click events for all buttons within the parent using a single event listener. It allows for a more dynamic and cleaner code.
