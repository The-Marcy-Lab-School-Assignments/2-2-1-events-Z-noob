# Question

What is event delegation?

# Answer

Event delegation is used in JavaScript to handle in scenarios where you have multiple elements that share the same event handler or where elements are dynamically added or removed from the DOM. Event delegation involves attaching a single event listener to a parent element that will react to events triggered by its child elements. The event listener on the parent element can then examine the `event.target` property to determine which child element triggered the event and take appropriate action.
